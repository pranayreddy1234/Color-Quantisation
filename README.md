# Color-Quantisation

color quantization or color image quantization is quantization applied to color spaces; it is a process that reduces the number of distinct colors used in an image, usually with the intention that the new image should be as visually similar as possible to the original image.

Color Quantization is generally done using clustering algorithms and in this project K-means is used for clustering and it is implemented from scratch without using any pre-defined libraries and functions.
